<h4>Navgurukul offers a fully-funded skilling program in software engineering 
   with guaranteed job to youth from low-income families.The program is for one<br>
   year and is a residential course.Our students come from different parts of
   the country and are the first person to get higher education in their families <br>
   and communities, first person to learn technology driven modern skills and get 
   aspirational jobs. The program and its pedagogy are focused on nourishing<br>
   changemakers and free thinkers who would become the light of change in their 
   own communities once they grow professionally. When one person steps out of<br>
   their community to achieve their dreams, she becomes an inspiration to many. 
   Thus, at Navgurukul, we are committed to taking our program to as many communities<br>
   as possible.Our partners help us give access to aspirational careers to youth who 
   want to grow but do not have means to do so. Our partnerships are the <br>
   backbone of our operations.Our partners share our values, our partners share our impact.
